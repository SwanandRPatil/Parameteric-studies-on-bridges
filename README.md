# Parameteric-studies-on-bridges
The Python codes stored in this repository were created during the completion of Master of Applied Science by the author at the university of British Columbia, Vancouver.
The codes were developed by Swanand Patil under the guidance of Professor Terje Haukaas at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.
There is one tcl file which is the finite element model of a three-span concrete bridge.
The files with "Main" in their title are the orchastrating codes for various parametric studies.
The files with "GM" in their names are the codes to generate stochastic ground motions.
The files with "FEM" in their names are finite element models in OpenSeesPy. The file "SwanandFEM4" contains Python code to process the OpenSees model of the bridge in tcl.
